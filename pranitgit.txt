 Did You Activate ClearTax as your ERI? 
The most crucial step to finish filing ITR smoothly. üèÅ
Hello! üëã,

Time's running out! The tax deadline is TOMORROW ‚è∞. We know you've been busy, but it's time to wrap up ITR filing ASAP. 

Filing on ClearTax is SUPER SIMPLIFIED, but if you‚Äôre having trouble linking your PAN, this might be because it's linked to another E-Return Intermediary (ERI).

Wondering what an ERI is? 	
An E-Return Intermediary (ERI) is an entity authorized by the Income Tax Department to facilitate the e-filing of tax returns. ClearTax is a certified ERI, ensuring a smooth and secure filing process.
Here‚Äôs how you can quickly activate ClearTax as your ERI

Verify Your ERI Status
1.Log into your Income Tax Account.
2.Navigate to Authorised Partners > My E-Return Intermediary.
3.Look under the Active and Inactive tabs.


Activate ClearTax ERI (ERIP000708)
1.If you find another ERI active, please deactivate it.
2.If ClearTax is listed under 'Inactive', click on ‚ÄòActivate‚Äô.
3.Once ClearTax ERI shows as "Active," you can proceed with filing on ClearTax.

Can‚Äôt See ClearTax in the list? Here‚Äôs What to Do
1.If ClearTax isn‚Äôt on the list, register your PAN on the ClearTax platform by authenticating with an OTP.
Why update now?
JUST ONE DAY LEFT! Thousands of Filers will access the ITD portal, leading to slower processing times. Update ERI and File now to avoid last-minute rush and penalties up to Rs. 5,000.	

Happy Filing!
